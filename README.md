# Pointing Party

Pointing Party is a web application to aid in agile story point estimation processes with minimal barriers
to entry. Simply start a game, share the URL, and start voting. Registration is neither necessary nor possible
and the application is built to be usable from all platforms and devices.

The project is powered by Blazor Server and does not rely on a backend database. Instead,
each client maintains its own game state based on events published on a central message bus.

This project uses .NET 8, Blazor, Mass Transit and Tailwind CSS.

## Try it out

The application can be found at https://pointingparty.fly.dev/. It comes without warranty, but feel
free to use it in your team.

## Contributing

The application has no dependencies outside of .NET 8 and publicly available NuGet. Simply clone
and run. Pull requests are welcome!
